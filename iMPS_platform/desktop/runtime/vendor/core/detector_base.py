"""Base class + common contract for all five competitors.

Rules of the competition:
  - one instance per session (fresh state via reset(), cross-session memory
    is allowed through the object the factory returns — that is a paradigm
    feature, e.g. Agentic AI keeps station baselines)
  - observe() is called once per event, in stream order, with the shared
    FeatureState; returning a non-empty list raises alert(s)
  - the FIRST alert of a session is what gets scored
  - no lookahead, no ground-truth access at inference time
