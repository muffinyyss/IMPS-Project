# iMPS portable PCAP runtime

This directory builds the Python/TShark sidecar used by the full Windows
desktop edition. The installed runtime needs neither Conda, Torch, sklearn,
nor access to the build machine's `F:`/`G:` drives.

Build from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File desktop\runtime\build_runtime.ps1
```

The build-time `ev_ai` interpreter converts the audited Torch checkpoints to
safe NumPy NPZ files. The runtime Python then packages an onedir executable
with PyInstaller. Outputs consumed by Electron are:

- `.desktop-build/runtime/imps-fault-runtime.exe`
- `.desktop-build/runtime/_internal/`
- `.desktop-build/models/lstm_ae.npz`
- `.desktop-build/models/gru_fore.npz`
- `.desktop-build/models/manifest.json`

Portable Wireshark/TShark is prepared separately at
`.desktop-build/runtime/wireshark/tshark.exe`.

Runtime CLI contract:

```text
imps-fault-runtime.exe serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port PORT \
  --origin http://127.0.0.1:WEB_PORT --summary SUMMARY_JSON \
  --model-dir MODELS --tshark TSHARK_EXE --jobs-root JOBS_DIR
```

The server launches the same executable in `worker` mode for one queued PCAP
at a time. Uploads are limited to 256 MiB, validated by extension and capture
magic, and stored under a random 128-bit job ID. Raw PCAP/telemetry files are
removed when analysis finishes; small result records expire after 30 days.
